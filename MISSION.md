# Curated.cx - Mission

## One line
Curated.cx turns good domains into niche "micro-networks" - part magazine, part directory, part community - that run mostly on autopilot and compound distribution over time.

## Mission
Build a portfolio of domain-backed communities that:
- pull the best content from across the web,
- organise it into something actually useful,
- layer in social proof and discussion,
- and distribute it automatically.

The selfish goal is simple: owned distribution I can reuse forever - to sell products, promote services, attract opportunities, and make domains worth something.

## Why this exists
The internet is full of signal, buried under:
- fragmented sources
- SEO sludge
- link dumps with no context
- communities that are great but hard to discover
- directories that go stale the second someone stops caring

Curated.cx is the antidote: a repeatable "vertical media engine" that makes a niche feel like it has a home.

## Vision
A network of high-signal, topic-specific properties that feel like:
- a daily briefing (news + context)
- a trusted index (tools, services, people)
- a small town noticeboard (jobs, events, opportunities)
- a comment section that doesn't make you hate humanity (most days)

Each site can stand alone as an asset. Collectively they become a distribution rail.

## What a Curated site is
Every domain runs the same playbook:

### Content
- Aggregated news and links (with source attribution and context)
- Editorial "explainers" and roundups (weekly, monthly, "best of")
- Topic pages that accumulate value over time (evergreen guides)

### Indexes (the stuff that monetises well)
- Tools / apps directory (tagged, comparable, searchable)
- Services directory (agencies, freelancers, consultants)
- Professionals directory (people worth following or hiring)
- Companies and products database (launches, updates, reviews)
- Jobs board (niche roles, better relevance)
- Events and calls for papers / tenders / grants (depends on the vertical)

### Community layer
- Submissions (anyone can add links, tools, jobs)
- Upvotes and saves (crowd ranking, not just chronology)
- Comments and discussion (context, debate, correction)
- Reputation (people earn trust by contributing signal)

### Distribution layer
- On-site feed that's SEO-friendly and browseable
- Email digests (daily/weekly, topic-specific)
- Social distribution (auto-posting with guardrails)
- RSS and simple syndication for power users

## The autonomy loop (how it compounds)
1. **Ingest**: pull from selected sources (publishers, blogs, feeds, APIs, web results).
2. **Normalise**: extract the useful bits, dedupe, classify, tag.
3. **Rank**: score items by relevance, freshness, source quality, and engagement signals.
4. **Editorialise**: generate short context (what it is, why it matters, who it affects) with clear attribution.
5. **Publish + distribute**: site + newsletter + social.
6. **Learn**: use clicks, upvotes, saves, hides, and comments to tune what gets surfaced next.

This is the core bet: distribution becomes a flywheel, not a daily chore.

## Monetisation (designed in, not bolted on)
This is a "media + marketplace" model. The money comes from the indexes.

- **Affiliate links** on tools and services listings (where programmes exist).
- **Sponsored placements**: featured tool, featured service, sponsored roundup, "vendor of the week".
- **Job posts**: pay-per-post, bundles, or subscriptions for recruiters/employers.
- **Premium listings**: verified badge, richer profile, case studies, priority ranking (clearly labelled).
- **Membership**: alerts, saved searches, deep filters, briefings, ad-light experience (optional).
- **Lead gen**: "get quotes" or "request intros" with a take-rate (vertical dependent).
- **Data products**: trend reports, market maps, "top vendors" lists, salary snapshots (once traffic is there).

There's precedent that curated tool directories can scale into serious traffic and userbases, which makes the monetisation mix realistic.

## What makes Curated.cx different
- **Multi-tenant by design**: one platform, many domains, repeatable playbook.
- **A directory that stays alive** because the news/community layer keeps it fresh.
- **A news feed that isn't disposable** because it feeds permanent indexes and topic pages.
- **Autonomy-first**: humans steer, they don't shovel.
- **Operator-owned distribution**: the asset is the audience, not the content.

## Guardrails (so it doesn't turn into spam soup)
- Strict attribution and source linking.
- Clear labelling of what's aggregated vs editorialised.
- Source quality controls (allowlists, blocklists, duplication rules).
- Anti-gaming: rate limits, trust tiers, vote abuse detection.
- Moderation tools that scale down as well as up (one-person operation should still work).

## What this is not
- Not a generic "write posts and hope" blog platform.
- Not a social network that requires constant manual feeding.
- Not a content farm.
- Not a place where brands can buy the truth.

## Success metrics
Per site:
- Organic sessions and returning visitors
- Newsletter subscribers and open/click rates
- Contribution rate (submissions, comments)
- Revenue per 1,000 visits and per subscriber
- Cost to operate (time/week should trend towards near-zero)

Portfolio-wide:
- Total audience reach across domains
- Cross-promotion lift (traffic and conversions between properties)
- Domain value (income + defensible niche position)

## Starting verticals
### ainews.cx
A high-signal AI briefing + tool index + jobs, with social ranking and weekly "what actually matters" roundups.

### construction.cx
Construction industry news + suppliers/services + tools + jobs (eventually tenders and procurement signals depending on what's feasible). A proof-point that this works outside the tech bubble.

(Construction already has established "marketplace" style ecosystems - Curated.cx is aiming for a lighter, more editorial, more community-driven version.)

## The endgame
Own a network of niche properties that:
- grows while I sleep,
- prints options (income, leads, credibility, jobs),
- and gives me permanent leverage for whatever I build next.

Distribution is the product. Everything else is how we earn it.
